# Rudiments

A Minecraft modpack for Fabric 1.19.2.

## Installation

The latest version of the modpack can be found [here](https://github.com/Eyxiong2/rudiments/releases/latest).

### Importing

If you are using a launcher that supports importing modpacks (e.g. the [Curseforge launcher](https://download.curseforge.com/), [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/), or [PrismLauncher](https://prismlauncher.org/)), download and import the **Curseforge pack** (titled `Rudiments-x.y.z.zip`) when creating a new instance.

As a note, [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric) maybe not install correctly due to weird things with Curseforge. If this happens, you can manually download the mod [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium/version/mc1.19.2-0.4.4) and place it in the mods directory.

### Manual

If you are using a launcher that doesn't support importing modpacks (e.g. the [official Minecraft launcher](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download)), download the **server pack** (titled `Rudiments-x.y.z-server.zip`) into your game folder and unzip the file.

*Rudiments* uses the Fabric launcher; the release notes specify the specific version of Fabric needed to play the modpack. you can download the Fabric installer [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/).

- Amethyst Imbuement

Have fun.
