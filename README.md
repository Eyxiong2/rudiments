# Rudiments

A Minecraft modpack for Fabric 1.19.2.

## Installation

The latest version of the modpack can be found [here](https://github.com/Eyxiong2/rudiments/releases/latest).

If you are using a launcher that supports importing modpacks (e.g. the [Curseforge launcher](https://download.curseforge.com/), [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/), or [PrismLauncher](https://prismlauncher.org/)), download and import the **Curseforge pack** (titled `Rudiments-x.y.z.zip`) when creating a new instance.

If you are using a launcher that doesn't support importing modpacks (e.g. the [official Minecraft launcher](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download)), download the **server pack** (titled `Rudiments-x.y.z-server.zip`) into your game folder and unzip the file.

## Design

The biggest content mods in the pack are:
- Amethyst Imbuement
- Botania
- Create
- ~~Industrial Revolution~~
- Twilight Forest
- Spectrum

Have fun.
